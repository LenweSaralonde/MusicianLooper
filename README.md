Looper pedal for Musician

Based on the BOSS RC pedals (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PFOOsVIv7c).

## How to use

When the looper pedal window is open, the pedal is controlled with the **ALT** key.

Press **ALT** to cycle between modes :
1. **REC** to start recording the loop.
2. **PLAY** to end the recording and start playing the recorded loop.
3. **DUB** to record new notes in the current loop.
4. Further presses cycle between **PLAY** and **DUB** modes.

Press ALT twice to stop and clear the loop.

## How to build an actual loop pedal for Musician

1. Take an old boring membrane keyboard.
2. Remove all the key caps except the one for the **left ALT** key.
3. Put the keyboard on the floor then connect it to your computer.
4. Enjoy!

You can use this trick to build a sustain pedal as well (strip all key caps except the spacebar).
